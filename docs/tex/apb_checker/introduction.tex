\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

The Roa Logic APB Bus Checker Verification IP helps designers use the ARM\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  AMBA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  APB bus in their designs. Throughout this document ARM\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  AMBA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}  APB will be simply refered to as APB.
The Roa Logic APB Bus Checker continuously snoops the APB bus and reports any protocol issues it detects.
In addition to rules checking, the ABP Bus Checker VIP contains an optional watchdog that fires when the APB Bus is unresponsive.
The APB Bus Checker VIP supports the following APB versions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  AMBA 2 APB Specification (Issue A), commonly known as APB2
\item
  AMBA 3 APB Specification (Issue B), commonly known as APB3
\item
  AMBA APB Specification (Issue C), commonly known as APB4
\item
  AMBA APB Specification (Issue D), commonly known as APB5
\end{itemize}

The Roa Logic APB Bus Checker VIP is released under the permissive GPLv3 license.
